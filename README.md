# Kami Clipboard

A GUI program that stays minimized in system tray keeping track of all clipboard changes, allowing the user to recall and copy anything they copied, even from several system shutdown ago.


### Installation

Compilation requires

-   `Visual Studio`
-   `C#.net`

### Usage

Once the executable is launched the user can see a list of their previous clipboard items and can click each abstract on the left to view the whole copied string. Clicking Copy will immediately copy the entire selection back into clipboard.

The program will stay in system tray when minimized and record all clipboard data to a database file in the user's documents folder.
